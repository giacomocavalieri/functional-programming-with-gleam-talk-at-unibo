# Functional programming with Gleam @ Unibo, 15th November 2023

This repo contains the slides I used for a talk I gave at the Cesena campus of the University of Bologna.
This event was orgnised by the student's group of the Computer Science course; the organisers were incredibly kind and I'll never thank them enough for letting me talk about two topics I love: functional programming and Gleam ðŸ’œ

This was my very first public talk and â€” despite being terrified by the huge audience â€” I had way more fun than anticipated!
It was lovely chatting with everyone after the talk and I want to thank everyone who joined and made this possible from the bottom of my heart!
